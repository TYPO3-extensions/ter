What does it do?
----------------

This extension provides the core functionality for the TYPO3 Extension Repository. It offers a SOAP webservice for
uploading and managing extensions and extension keys and stores all extensions as files which are accessible directly
via HTTP. It does not provide a frontend – this task is handled by other extensions like ter\_fe.

.. note:: This extension requires PHP 5.0.0 or higher with the SOAP extension enabled.


.. _history:

History of this extension
-------------------------

The TER2 project was started at the TYPO3 Snowboard tour, the T3BOARD05. The initial design was done by Michael Hirdes,
Karsten Dambekalns and Robert Lemke and refined several times after by taking many suggestions from the community into
account.

The first version until beta state was developed by Robert Lemke in more than 250 hours. The german TYPO3 agency
punkt.de has graciously supported most of the development financially. Thanks a lot for this big gift to the TYPO3
community!
